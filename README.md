Hey there, welcome to my corner of the internet! ðŸ‘‹

With a solid foundation in both technical and financial domains, Iâ€™m currently working on a mix of personal projects while navigating challenging coursework. I thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy constantly experimenting with new ideas and approaches. If you have an exciting project or innovative idea, feel free to reach out at s6suthak@uwaterloo.caâ€”letâ€™s build something awesome! ðŸš€

In my free time, I enjoy watching sitcoms (arguably the world's biggest fan of _The Office_ ðŸ˜„) and reading through my Goodreads recommendations ðŸ“–. Iâ€™m always up for learning something new and expanding my skill set! ðŸš€
